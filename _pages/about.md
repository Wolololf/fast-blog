Hi, thanks for dropping by!

My name is Wolfgang. I'm a game developer by day, and an ancient history and linguistics enthusiast by night.

I've been dabbling in data science for a while, to analyse and visualise topics I was interested in. More recently, I've become interested in the use of AI/ML in those areas. I'm hoping that some of what I learnt on the way will be of use to you :-)
