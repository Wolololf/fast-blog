            "content": "The problem . A while ago, I was doing a small visualisation project on an ancient history topic, and as part of that, I needed to express dates and times around 400BC. Sounds simple enough, right? Python has a datetime module, just use that and we&#39;re golden. . Well, not so fast. The MINYEAR is 1AD, so we can&#39;t express BC dates like that. We&#39;ll need a different solution. . What are our requirements for a good solution? What functionality are we looking for? . Expressing BC as well as AD dates | Create from string and/or numeric parameters | Print time | Getters | Add/subtract time span and getting time deltas | Get time span delta | Lightweight enough to use in pandas | . # Imports from datetime import datetime, timedelta . . 1. Data science libraries . Numpy - datetime64 + timedelta64 . Numpy&#39;s datetime64 and timedelta64 extends Python&#39;s base datetime/timedelta from 32 to 64 bit and also adds some extra functionality. . import numpy as np . . Numpy: Creating times BC/AD . Both classes support a range of +/-2.9e11 years with a second precision which should be enough for most purposes. . # Example code for creating BC and AD times ad_date_np = np.datetime64(&quot;2020-01-02T03:04:05&quot;) print(ad_date_np) bc_date_np = np.datetime64(&quot;-00400-01-02T03:04:05&quot;) print(bc_date_np) . . 2020-01-02T03:04:05 -400-01-02T03:04:05 . Numpy: Getters . Numpy doesn&#39;t provide extraction functions out of the box, but we can roll our own based on the string representation (inspired by this stack overflow answer). . def dt2cal(dt): &quot;&quot;&quot; Convert datetime64 to a calendar array of year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, microsecond.

Numpy: Time spans . timedelta64 handles addition and subtraction as expected; the only thing worth calling out is the concept of time scale inherent in Numpy&#39;s time classes: To operate on two timedelta64 objects, they both need to have the same time scale, i.e. both need to have the [Y], [d], etc format. You can easily convert these using .astype(timedelta64[X]). . This also holds for printing: The first print in the code below prints as seconds, which isn&#39;t very useful, but you can cast it to a better time scale such as years for better readability. Similarly, you need to specify the time scale when creating a time delta from scratch. . delta_np = ad_date_np - bc_date_np print(delta_np) print(delta_np.astype(&quot;timedelta64[D]&quot;)) print(delta_np.astype(&quot;timedelta64[Y]&quot;)) new_delta_np = np.timedelta64(123, &#39;D&#39;) print(new_delta_np) print(delta_np - new_delta_np) print(ad_date_np + new_delta_np) . . 76367836800 seconds 883887 days 2420 years 123 days 76357209600 seconds 2020-05-04T03:04:05 . Conclusion . Numpy is a solid choice if all you need is to cover a large range of times. Creating and dealing with dates and time spans is fairly straightforward, and the objects are lean as can be. As we&#39;ve seen, we can compensate for the lack of easy extraction functions with our own workarounds, but it&#39;s not as efficient as if it was supported natively, and is prone to breaking as the language evolves. . Pandas . Pandas is the standard framework many data scientists use when dealing with large amounts of data. Its to_datetime method is a great way to convert columns of dates from strings to Pandas Timestamps which wrap Numpy&#39;s datetime64. . #Imports import pandas as pd . . df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;date&#39;: [&#39;1970-1-2 03:04:05&#39;, &#39;2020-6-7 08:09:10&#39;], &#39;value&#39;: [2, 3]}) df[&#39;date&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(df[&#39;date&#39;], format=&quot;%Y-%d-%m %H:%M:%S&quot;) df . . date value . 0 1970-02-01 03:04:05 | 2 | . 1 2020-07-06 08:09:10 | 3 | . Pandas: Creating times BC/AD . Since Pandas internally uses datetime64, we should just be able to use to_datetime on both BC and AD dates and we&#39;re all good to go, right? Wrong. While Pandas does use 64 bits to represent time, it does so at a precision of nanoseconds which severly limits the available date range as discussed here. . # This will result in an error: #date = pd.to_datetime(&#39;-400-01-02T03:04:05&#39;, format=&quot;%Y-%d-%m %H:%M:%S&quot;) . . If you try to parse a value before 1677AD, you&#39;ll get this error: . ValueError: time data &#39;-400-01-02T03:04:05&#39; does not match format &#39;%Y-%d-%m %H:%M:%S&#39; (match). . The error message is a bit misleading since the input format is just fine, the problem is that the date itself falls outside the supported range. So to_datetime is out. . What if we populated our data frames directly with datetime64? . df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;date&#39;: [np.datetime64(&#39;-400-01-02T03:04:05&#39;), np.datetime64(&#39;2020-06-07T08:09:10&#39;)], &#39;value&#39;: [2, 3]}) df . . date value . 0 -400-01-02T03:04:05 | 2 | . 1 2020-06-07T08:09:10 | 3 | . This works beautifully! Looks like we can get our BC dates into Pandas data frames after all. . So we can use datetime64 directly, we just don&#39;t have the convenience of assembling Timestamps straight from string column(s). Here&#39;s a utility function that converts datetime64-compatible strings and puts them back into the column. . def custom_to_datetime_from_date(df): df[&#39;date&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: np.datetime64(row[&#39;date&#39;]), axis=1) return df . . test_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;date&#39;: [&#39;-400-01-02T03:04:05&#39;, &#39;2020-06-07T08:09:10&#39;], &#39;value&#39;: [2, 3]}) print(test_df) test_df = custom_to_datetime_from_date(test_df) test_df . . date value 0 -400-01-02T03:04:05 2 1 2020-06-07T08:09:10 3 . date value . 0 -400-01-02T03:04:05 | 2 | . 1 2020-06-07T08:09:10 | 3 | . Another great use of to_datetime is its ability to assemble Timestamps from multiple colums, e.g. year, month, etc. Here&#39;s what a workaround for this could look like: . helper_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;column_names&#39;: [&#39;month&#39;, &#39;day&#39;, &#39;hour&#39;, &#39;minute&#39;, &#39;second&#39;, &#39;ms&#39;, &#39;ns&#39;], &#39;date_args&#39;: [&#39;M&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;ms&#39;, &#39;ns&#39;], &#39;offsets&#39;: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}) print(helper_df) def row_to_date_from_time_columns(row): if not &#39;year&#39; in row: return None date = np.datetime64(row[&#39;year&#39;], &#39;Y&#39;) for idx, r in helper_df.iterrows(): name = r[&#39;column_names&#39;] if name in row: arg = r[&#39;date_args&#39;] date += np.timedelta64(row[name], arg) offset = r[&#39;offsets&#39;] if offset != 0: date -= np.timedelta64(offset, arg) return date def custom_to_datetime_from_time_columns(df, drop_source_columns=False): df[&#39;date&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: row_to_date_from_time_columns(row), axis=1) if drop_source_columns: df = df.drop(helper_df[&#39;column_names&#39;], axis=1, errors=&#39;ignore&#39;) return df . . column_names date_args offsets 0 month M 1 1 day D 1 2 hour h 0 3 minute m 0 4 second s 0 5 ms ms 0 6 ns ns 0 . test_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;year&#39;: [&#39;-400&#39;, &#39;2020&#39;], &#39;month&#39;: [&#39;01&#39;, &#39;02&#39;], &#39;day&#39;: [&#39;03&#39;, &#39;04&#39;], &#39;value&#39;: [2, 3]}) print(test_df) test_df = custom_to_datetime_from_time_columns(test_df, True) test_df . . year month day value 0 -400 01 03 2 1 2020 02 04 3 . year value date . 0 -400 | 2 | -400-01-03 | . 1 2020 | 3 | 2020-02-04 | . For efficiency&#39;s sake, I&#39;ve moved some of the arrays outside the function. You should further adjust this by removing the columns you don&#39;t need, but this should be a good starting point. . And finally, a combined version that converts the date column if it exists, or assembles time-related columns if it doesn&#39;t: . helper_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;column_names&#39;: [&#39;month&#39;, &#39;day&#39;, &#39;hour&#39;, &#39;minute&#39;, &#39;second&#39;, &#39;ms&#39;, &#39;ns&#39;], &#39;date_args&#39;: [&#39;M&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39;s&#39;, &#39;ms&#39;, &#39;ns&#39;], &#39;offsets&#39;: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}) def row_to_date(row): if &#39;date&#39; in row: return np.datetime64(row[&#39;date&#39;]) if not &#39;year&#39; in row: return None date = np.datetime64(row[&#39;year&#39;], &#39;Y&#39;) for idx, r in helper_df.iterrows(): name = r[&#39;column_names&#39;] if name in row: arg = r[&#39;date_args&#39;] date += np.timedelta64(row[name], arg) offset = r[&#39;offsets&#39;] if offset != 0: date -= np.timedelta64(offset, arg) return date def custom_to_datetime(df, drop_source_columns=False): df[&#39;date&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: row_to_date(row), axis=1) if drop_source_columns: df = df.drop(helper_df[&#39;column_names&#39;], axis=1, errors=&#39;ignore&#39;) return df . . Great, so we&#39;ve worked around that limitation in Pandas! However, this still doesn&#39;t solve the Timestamp limitation in DatetimeIndex and PeriodIndex. . Since we can create columns of datetime64 from strings now, maybe we can use the origin parameter of datetime64 and turn them into dates based on the Julian calender? This would mean that we can get a datetime64 with origin 4713BC that counts days from that date. Sounds like a good solution? Can we trick Timestamp into accepting a valid datetime64 and have it not modify it? . julian_origin = np.datetime64(&#39;-4713-01-01T12:00:00&#39;) test_input = np.datetime64(&#39;-400-01-02&#39;) # This will error out with: # OutOfBoundsDatetime: 1574925 is Out of Bounds for origin=&#39;julian&#39; #pd.to_datetime((test_input - julian).astype(&#39;timedelta64[D]&#39;).astype(int), unit=&#39;D&#39;, origin=&#39;julian&#39;) . . Nope, doesn&#39;t work. There is simply no way to get Timestamp to extend its range, even if you pass in a Julian datetime64. Pandas takes that representation and converts it to datetime64[ns] which again only goes as far back as 1677AD. . Pandas gives you false hope by stating that you can provide a different origin to to_datetime like this: pd.to_datetime([1, 2, 3], unit=&quot;D&quot;, origin=pd.Timestamp(&quot;1960-01-01&quot;)). However, for that to work, the origin Timestamp needs to be valid in the first place. So we&#39;d need to create a BC Timestamp to use as an origin point to get BC Timestamps, which we can&#39;t do because BC Timestamps aren&#39;t valid. Great. I guess we just can&#39;t use DateTimeIndex. . Pandas: Getters . Timestamp and DatetimeIndex have a great selection of component getters (as described here. Sadly, we can&#39;t use any of them since we can&#39;t use Timestamp/DatetimeIndex... . The best we can do is use the getters defined above as a starting point and write per-component extractor utilities instead of returning the full array. I&#39;ll leave this as an exercise to the reader ;-) . Pandas: Time spans . One would think that if you have a working column of datetime64 objects and try to apply timedelta64 operations to the whole column, it would work. However, Pandas helpfully attempts to convert the column to Timestamps before applying the operation, which of course fails since our data is outside the Timestamp limits. Instead, we have to apply operations row-by-row, not using the column shorthand. . (Again, note that type casts are required to make the datetime64 in second-format compatible with the timedelta64 which is in year-format due to its construction.) . test_df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;date&#39;: [&#39;-400-01-02T03:04:05&#39;, &#39;2020-06-07T08:09:10&#39;], &#39;value&#39;: [2, 3]}) test_df = custom_to_datetime(test_df) sub_ts = np.timedelta64(100, &#39;Y&#39;) # Pandas will attempt to convert the date column into a Timestamp and crashes as a result #test_df[&#39;date&#39;] -= sub_ts test_df[&#39;date&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row: row[&#39;date&#39;] - sub_ts.astype(&#39;m8[s]&#39;), axis=1) test_df . . date value . 0 -500-01-01T21:04:05 | 2 | . 1 1920-06-08T02:09:10 | 3 | . Conclusion . You can make Pandas work with Numpy&#39;s 64-bit time classes, it just needs some workarounds and a careful approach to keep Pandas from accidentally attempting an automatic conversion. Pandas usually adds a lot of utility to extend Numpy&#39;s time handling, but since they&#39;re all tied into range-limited classes, we can&#39;t use most of them. . Some articles that discuss the advantages of Pandas&#39; time handling can be found here and here, just so you know what you&#39;re missing out on. . 2. Scientific libraries . It looks like there aren&#39;t a whole lot of historians using Python, but who know who else uses BC dates? Astronomers! There appears to be quite a selection of scientific libraries that deal with dates outside the default Python date range. . Astropy . Astropy&#39;s Time module does the job. It supports a wide variety of time scales, formats and precision that are handy in general, plus some highly astronomy specific functionality such as earth_rotation_angle and light_travel_time. The documentation does a good job explaining how to create and work with Time. . This is an incredibly powerful library, and the documentation rocks. The Time object supports common operations such as creating, modifying and printing dates and time spans. . One downside is that it has a lot of functionality you likely won&#39;t need, so it looks intimidating and confusing at first glance. While it looks like this added functionality would also bloat the object, this isn&#39;t a problem in practice. In addition to taking a string as input, Time also takes an ndarray of strings, and can be interacted with like an array. This means that effectively, you only need to define your time format and such once for the Time object, and the individual times can then be accessed by index. . #Imports from astropy.time import Time, TimeDelta . . Astropy: Creating times BC/AD . One caveat is that we shouldn&#39;t use the standard ISO/ISOT format, e.g. 2020-01-02T03:04:05. The ISO format only works for AD dates! Instead, we should use the FITS format, e.g. -00400-01-02T03:04:05. FITS is an extension to the ISO format that expands the year range to five digits, and supports BC dates. Be aware that for negative dates, you need to pad it out with leading zeroes, or you&#39;ll get a parsing exception! . # Example code for creating BC and AD times ad_date_astro = Time(&quot;2020-01-01T01:23:45&quot;, format=&#39;fits&#39;, scale=&#39;utc&#39;) print(ad_date_astro) bc_date_astro = Time(&quot;-00400-01-01T01:23:45&quot;, format=&#39;fits&#39;, scale=&#39;utc&#39;) print(bc_date_astro) dates_astro = Time([&quot;-00400-01-01T01:23:45&quot;, &quot;2020-01-01T01:23:45&quot;], format=&#39;fits&#39;, scale=&#39;utc&#39;) print(dates_astro) print(dates_astro[0]) . . 2020-01-01T01:23:45.000 -00400-01-01T01:23:45.000 [&#39;-00400-01-01T01:23:45.000&#39; &#39;+02020-01-01T01:23:45.000&#39;] -00400-01-01T01:23:45.000 . /usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/erfa/core.py:154: ErfaWarning: ERFA function &#34;dtf2d&#34; yielded 1 of &#34;dubious year (Note 6)&#34; warnings.warn(&#39;ERFA function &#34;{}&#34; yielded {}&#39;.format(func_name, wmsg), /usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/erfa/core.py:154: ErfaWarning: ERFA function &#34;d2dtf&#34; yielded 1 of &#34;dubious year (Note 5)&#34; warnings.warn(&#39;ERFA function &#34;{}&#34; yielded {}&#39;.format(func_name, wmsg), . The above warning seems to be benign and from well within Astropy, nothing to do for us here. . Side note: You can get your time data in a different format by using .isot, .unix. Note that you can print time in formats that wouldn&#39;t support parsing it! . print(ad_date_astro.unix) print(bc_date_astro.fits) print(bc_date_astro.isot) # This line would fail with a ValueError: &quot;Input values did not match the format class isot&quot; #bc_date_2 = Time(bc_date.isot, format=&#39;isot&#39;, scale=&#39;utc&#39;) . . 1577841825.0 -00400-01-01T01:23:45.000 -400-01-01T01:23:45.000 . Astropy: Getters . The Time class doesn&#39;t have an easy way to extract common attributes such as year, month or seconds. It does, however, support strftime and provides an implementation based on Python&#39;s time.strftime. This means we can define our own utility functions to extract the relevant components and parse them into integers for later use. . Sadly, this doesn&#39;t work for BC dates since strftime internally assumes dates in the ISO format for some reason. . #Getters def extract_year(t): return int(t.strftime(&#39;%Y&#39;)) extract_year(ad_date_astro) . . 2020 . There is always the option of writing our own function to extract time components from the source string, and I might revisit this section later on to do just that. We&#39;d have to use the FITS representation and parse the date string ourselves which shouldn&#39;t be too involved. . #TODO: Write time component extraction function based on FITS string representation . . Astropy: Time spans . Astropy comes with a TimeDelta class that supports all common time span operations, such as add/subtract and new instance creation. The most common constructors are from seconds or from datetime.timedelta. . delta_astro = ad_date_astro - bc_date_astro print(delta_astro.datetime) new_delta_astro = TimeDelta(123456789, format=&#39;sec&#39;) print(new_delta_astro.datetime) new_delta_astro = TimeDelta(timedelta(days=123456), format=&#39;datetime&#39;) print(new_delta_astro.datetime) print((delta_astro - new_delta_astro).datetime) print(ad_date_astro + new_delta_astro) . . 883887 days, 0:00:37 1428 days, 21:33:09 123456 days, 0:00:00 760431 days, 0:00:37 2358-01-05T01:23:45.000 . /usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/erfa/core.py:154: ErfaWarning: ERFA function &#34;utctai&#34; yielded 1 of &#34;dubious year (Note 3)&#34; warnings.warn(&#39;ERFA function &#34;{}&#34; yielded {}&#39;.format(func_name, wmsg), /usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/erfa/core.py:154: ErfaWarning: ERFA function &#34;taiutc&#34; yielded 1 of &#34;dubious year (Note 4)&#34; warnings.warn(&#39;ERFA function &#34;{}&#34; yielded {}&#39;.format(func_name, wmsg), /usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/erfa/core.py:154: ErfaWarning: ERFA function &#34;d2dtf&#34; yielded 1 of &#34;dubious year (Note 5)&#34; warnings.warn(&#39;ERFA function &#34;{}&#34; yielded {}&#39;.format(func_name, wmsg), . Conclusion . Astropy&#39;s time module offers a lot more functionality than we need which makes its objects clunky and its API quite complex. This is offset by having the option to keep an array of datetimes in the Time object itself, same as with TimeDelta, which lets us manipulate them as we would with ndarrays. The downside is that this wouldn&#39;t work well with libraries such as Pandas. . Skyfield . TODO: Overview . Skyfield: Creating times BC/AD . # TODO . . Skyfield: Getters . # TODO . .

It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( alt.X(&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, type=&#39;quantitative&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, ), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Example 3: More Tooltips . label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) . Data Tables . You can display tables per the usual way in your blog: . df[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Worldwide_Gross&#39;, &#39;Production_Budget&#39;, &#39;Distributor&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;]].head() .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
