    "### [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)\n",
    "Astropy's [Time](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.time.Time.html) module does the job. It supports a wide variety of time scales, formats and precision that are handy in general, plus some highly astronomy specific functionality such as `earth_rotation_angle` and `light_travel_time`. The [documentation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/) does a good job explaining how to create and work with `Time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an incredibly powerful library, and the documentation rocks. The `Time` object supports common operations such as creating, modifying and printing dates and time spans.\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside is that it has a lot of functionality you likely won't need, so it looks intimidating and confusing at first glance. While it looks like this added functionality would also bloat the object, this isn't a problem in practice. In addition to taking a string as input, `Time` also takes an `ndarray` of strings, and can be interacted with like an array. This means that effectively, you only need to define your time format and such once for the `Time` object, and the individual times can then be accessed by index."

    "#### Astropy: Creating times BC/AD\n",
    "One caveat is that we shouldn't use the standard [ISO/ISOT format](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.time.TimeISOT.html#astropy.time.TimeISOT), e.g. `2020-01-02T03:04:05`. The ISO format only works for AD dates! Instead, we should use the [FITS format](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.time.TimeFITS.html#astropy.time.TimeFITS), e.g. `-00400-01-02T03:04:05`. FITS is an extension to the ISO format that expands the year range to five digits, and supports BC dates. Be aware that for negative dates, you need to pad it out with leading zeroes, or you'll get a parsing exception!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is that despite using 5 digits, you can't actually represent dates before 4799 BC (so slightly before the start of the Julian calendar). For a discussion about why this is limitation exists, see [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/9231)."
